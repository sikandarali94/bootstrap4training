# Bootstrap 4 Training

This project was created to document the various features of Bootstrap 4 and how to implement them in our code. The project was finished on 29/06/2018 8:15AM Sydney, Australia time. 

The project sections are all laid out clearly in the commits for this repository. Find the commit that relates to the Bootstrap 4 feature you want to learn, fork it, read the code along with the comments and load the code on your browser. Simple as that!

This project would not have been possible without the Bootstrap 4 sandbox created by Brad Traversy. You can find all of his premium courses on Udemy at: https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/learn/v4/overview.

Have fun learning to code!
